The primary focus of the class is the development of narrative projects. Projects can be web sites, computer games, live action role-playing games, videos or improv performances. Students are invited to propose interesting projects to illustrate their perspectives of the subject matter. All project proposals must be approved by the instructors.

Students have to complete three main projects, evenly scheduled through the semester:  
Hypertext (individual or group) (Week 2-5)  
Film/Performance (group) (Week 6-9)  
Game (group) (Week 10-13)

Each project is worth 25% of the final grade.
